 In events and conferences, attendees tweet and hashtag about event to present their own view, interest and comments.  “Tab3” is meant to help the audience to follow these tweets and hashtags.  “Tab3” in Arabic means to follow.  It is basically going to read the most trending tweet in Twitter.  In order to achieve that we generate a code using Python and we install it in a virtual machine called Rasbery-Pi. The code will scan twitter and see what is the most re-twitted tweet. The purpose of that is to know what are the interest of people, what they are thinking of, what are the main events they are attending and what are the up next events.
